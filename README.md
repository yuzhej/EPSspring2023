EPS Course Project Work

Description
There are growing interests in the Health industry to improve overall population health as the worldâ€™s population continues to grow and the increased travels promotes increased flow between countries.  One of great benefits from such focus is to prepare for any ongoing disease outbreaks, like COVID-19, by understanding these disease impacts and overcrowding. In order to focus on these disease related outbreaks, this project attempts to build predictive modeling for patient admissions. Overcrowding would happen when no ICU beds are available at the hospital to admit new patients, which could also be the result of admitting too many non-emergency patients.       

There are ways to build predictive modeling for incoming volume of patients utilizing overall population health but there are also some challenges, such as privacy. If privacy issues can be resolved, hospital operations and leadership will likely implement such a tool/product, which can save operational costs by appropriately allocating budgets for beds/work forces. 

In this project, I initially tested out TensorFlow Federated learning to understand the underlying algorithm for TensorFlow Federated learning by reading published papers and relevant working documentations and projects related to Federated learning. Once the fundamental understanding had been built, I installed TensorFlow Federated and started to run the demo guide on TensorFlow Federated learning. Then, I started to process COVID-19 datasets available on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by exploring and cleaning data.
